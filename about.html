          <p>Recycling is the No. 1 action we can take for the environment, the economy, and our future on this planet. If we recycle more and recycle right, more companies will be able to start using recycled materials in their manufacturing, rather than depleting limited natural resources. Recycling right creates jobs; saves water, energy, and money; and can improve our health and the well-being of all species.</p>
         
We aim to encourage more HDB residents to recycle using the existing blue recycling bins in their estates, and to educate them on recycling correctly.
