## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 1

# Save The Planet 
This is a front-end website called "Save The Planet" 

## This website was created as a project for Code Institute. To view the live site, [CLICK HERE](https://abdoelsaih.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project-1/index.html)

## About the website
Recycling is the No. 1 action we can take for the environment, the economy, and our future on this planet. If we recycle more and recycle right, more companies will be able to start using recycled materials in their manufacturing, rather than depleting limited natural resources. Recycling right creates jobs; saves water, energy, and money; and can improve our health and the well-being of all species.

We aim to encourage more HDB residents to recycle using the existing blue recycling bins in their estates, and to educate them on recycling correctly.

## UX 
The website was built for all residents for an easy reach of basic information about benefits of recycling such as:
### " Glass Recycling"
Glass is taken from the bin and taken to a glass treatment plant. The glass is sorted by colour and washed to remove any impurities. The glass is then crushed and melted, then moulded into new products such as bottles and jars. ... Glass does not degrade through the recycling process, so it can be recycled again and again

### "Plastic Recycling" 
Plastic Recycling helps to reduce the energy usage, It reduces the consumption of fresh raw materials, It reduces the water pollution and the air pollution (from the land filling) by reducing the need for conventional waste disposal and it reduces the greenhouse gases emissions

### "Cardboard Recycling" 
Benefits of recycling cardboard and brown paper bags,Using a recycled material, rather than a raw material conserves energy and natural resources and helps reduce pollution. Making the pulp used in cardboard creates sulfur dioxide, a gas that causes acid rain. Recycling cardboard cuts that pollution in half
